1.all of them linear, write the 4 later
2.cylinders and displacement -> higher ,,,,,, origin and year -> lower
3. The most significent is (displacement), The best model is the mgp displacement model (cause it has the highest R2 value) while the worst is the mpg and year model ( negative value of R2)
4. the model fit is by far much better than the best model in the previous problem with an R2 score of 0.47
